<h1>What I learned from Lesson 1</h1>

<h2><em>How the World Wide Web works</em></h2>

<p>The web is a series of networks that link your computer to other computers and servers. Using a web browser from your personal computer, you can type in url link to a webpage and a signal (HTTP Request) is sent through your internet provider and routed to the server that is hosting that webpage. The server retrieves the appropriate HTML document and returns it to your computer, where the browswer reads it.
</p>

<h2><em>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language</em></h2>

<p>Most content on the internet is made up of HTML. It contains tags, elements, and attributes. HTML is the language of your browser. It contains text and markup (how it looks).
</p>

<h2><em>Tags, Elements and Attributes</em></h2>

<p>Tags are names surrounded by "< >" which define the content inside and tell it what to do. Attributes are values inside the opening tag that provide additional instructions for the content. Some examples of tags and attributes are b for <b>bold</b>b>, em for <em>italics</em>, a href = for <a href="www.google.com">links</a>, and br for <br>
breaks<br>
Elements are groupings of HTML code. Individual tags can be an element, or the entire body can be one. 	
</p>

<h2><u>Inline vs Block</u></h2>

<p>HTML can be displayed in either <div>block</div> or <span><strong>inline</strong></span> elements. Inline only takes up as much width as necessary whereas block elements take up the entire width allowed. Block elements can be described as having an invisible box around them that defines the area.
